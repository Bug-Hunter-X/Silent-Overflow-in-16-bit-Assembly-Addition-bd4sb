```assembly
mov ax, 0x1234
add ax, 0x5678
mov bx, ax
; ... further operations using bx ...
```

The error is subtle: if the result of `add ax, 0x5678` exceeds the 16-bit capacity of the `ax` register (65535), an overflow occurs.  The upper bits are silently truncated, leading to an incorrect value in `ax` and subsequently `bx`.  This is a common error when working with integer arithmetic in assembly, especially when dealing with unsigned values where the standard behavior is silent overflow.
